Everyone wants to become a crorepati in 10 years, but very few know the math behind it. 

If you save 30% of your income, increase it by 10% each year, and earn 12% post-tax returns,
you’ll need to make ₹12 lakh per year to hit that 1 crore mark.

How? When inflation surges, prices of goods rise, and corporates benefit, driving up stock prices.
Even in chaos, being invested in the index protects your purchasing power.

It’s a fascinating take on how inflation and markets truly work, even in economies under pressure.

I have seen a lot of folks feeling sad about not getting into a good college but worry not, because we have an Under 25 app with us.

This app is more like a one stop solution to all the college students who want to achieve out of the box.

In this app, you can network with like minded people across the country, find internships, start your freelancing journey and a lot more.

I highly suggest this app to all the students out there, only because college is the best time to explore because as a student we have so much more free time and less responsibility.

As students we have 4 years of buffer time to figure out where you want to head your career in, and the Under 25 app is doing exactly that, in helping you make max use of your college life.

"Watch this if you have a Car 

A standard comprehensive policy pays out the IDV, which is the vehicle’s value after depreciation.

An RTI add-on ensures that the claim payout is the full invoice value of the car, covering costs like registration fees and road tax, which a standard policy does not.

For example, if you bought a car for 8 lakh (including taxes) and it is declared a total loss, a standard policy would pay the depreciated IDV, but RTI would pay the original 8 lakh.

"✅No more gas cylinder fires because vou can replace your old cylinder with a new composite cylinder. These new-age composite clinders offer several advantages over the existing steel cylinders:

They are lightweight: the tare weight of a composite cylinder is half that of its steel counterpart.
They have a translucent body that helps customers accurately check the LPG level against the light, making it easier to plan the next refill.
They are rust-free and do not corrode, reducing the chances of leaving stains and marks on surfaces.
They are aesthetically designed, making them visually appealing and ideal for modern kitchens.
They are safer to use, being explosion-proof.
Currently, Indane is the only provider of composite cylinders in all major cities, available in 5 kg and 10 kg sizes, but other companies may offer them soon.
Customers can replace their existing steel cylinder with the state-of-the-art composite cylinder by paying the difference in the security deposit.

Then fly back from Ho Chi Minh to India for about 52k miles total (26k per person), meaning your round-trip Business Class flights for two cost under 1L points.

Next, move your Axis Atlas points to Accor Hotels (1:2) and stay at top properties like Mövenpick Hanoi and Premier Residences Phu Quoc, with hotel stays worth over ₹1.2L covered by 30k Atlas points.

"Education loan insurance 

This Insurance is designed to provide financial protection to students who have taken an education loan to study abroad.

Just in case the borrower is unable to repay the loan due to unforeseen circumstances, then the education loan insurance will cover the outstanding amount, ensuring that the burden does not fall on the borrower’s family or the co applicant. 

Generally the insurance will cost you somewhere around 0.5% of the total loan amount if you have borrowed loan in Public Sector banks or 1-1.5% if it is a private bank.

For eg: if the loan is of 1Cr, then the insurance will cost you somewhere around 50,000 to 1 lakh rupees.

But remember, there is a lock in period of 21 years & you can invest only before your girl child turns 10 years of age.

You can open an SSY account at any nearest post office or any nearest bank.

A lot of people have faced many problems finding a house in Bangalore : No bachelor allowed, High Rent, 10 months rent as a security deposit, big fat contracts, can’t vacate before 9 months, else the owner will take 1-month extra rent etc.

Here are few things you should know:

A lot of rental agreements have clearly mentioned that if you inform your house owner that you will be leaving the house 1 month prior itself, then house owner is not supposed to charge you a single penny as a penalty.

Also sometimes when you don’t pay rent on time due to some legitimate reasons, things might not go well with the owner, that’s why, Housing.com has come up with Pay on Credit feature where you will get interest free credit period of 45 days where you will have sufficient time to repay it back with NO INTEREST.

By this way, not only your credit score is built, but also you will earn a lot of reward points which can be redeemed later.

"An office designed around how people work and collaborate! 

I spent a day at Atlassian’s new office in Bengaluru, and it made me completely rethink what a workplace should be like.

There are 3 zones designed to match how people actually work,
A Quiet Zone for deep focus and individual work
A Traditional Zone where you can expect a moderate level of background activity and conversation
An Energized Zone for collaborative work and higher energy

Atlassian’s distributed work policy is called ‘Team Anywhere’. It allows Atlassians to choose their preferred work location daily, whether it’s their home, a public space, or any of Atlassian’s 13 global offices, as long as they have a legal right to work in that country. 

And they have some really well-equipped ”collaboration studios”, event spaces, and many other work arrangements of various types and sizes, so that when they’re in office, they’re able to meet and collaborate with others really effectively. 

Experiencing it firsthand, I realized how Atlassian’s office isn’t just a place to work — it’s an extension of their Team Anywhere philosophy, giving people the freedom to choose the environment that powers their best work individually and collectively.

The full video of the office tour is out on my LinkedIn.

"My college diary  

I used to get only ₹3,000/month as pocket money & it used to be very hard for me to manage my daily expenses because Bangalore is quite expensive.

So whatever money I used to receive from my home, it used to get spent within 2 weeks itself and for the rest of the days, I used to be literally broke and sometimes in emergency situations I had no option but to remove the account balance from my bank account.

And after checking my balance after few days, my account balance was -120 rs. Trust me, I was like “How’s that even possible?”

Back then, I didn’t know any way out, but now I actually see a lot of friends face such situations.

Touch wood, but just in case if your account balance hits negative, then please complain at bankingombudsman.rbi.org.in because RBI has released a notice that, banks cannot charge you a single penny fine once your account balance hits 0 and not take additional money which leads the balance to hit negative.

"Best way to travel in metro cities 

I have lived in Bangalore for almost 7 years and it used to get really hard to travel to some of the places which have no metro connectivity.

And we all know the Cab issues in most of the cities, it’s either too expensive or it is very hard to get a cab.

As a student back then, the easier & more efficient way to travel was having a scooter, so I started searching for a used scooter and trust me, it was a very tough experience, as I had to spend scrolling on the internet all day long and to add more spice, it was the trust issues.

We have no guarantee how the bike condition would be, we would have very less to no information regarding the history of that scooter.

But this won’t be a problem anymore, coz we now have BeepKart, where you can now buy or sell 2 wheeler without any tension because there’s 

 1 year warranty
 3 free services
 3 days or 100kms love it or return it option and assured buyback.

What was expected to happen in 18 months, happened in just 6.
That’s not normal growth… that’s momentum on steroids. ⚡

When prices rise too fast, even experts get nervous — because what goes up that quick, can fall just as fast.
So the real question isn’t “Will gold rise?”
It’s “Can you handle the drop when it does?”

 Would you still buy gold today or wait for the dip?

"We all have heard from our parents saying that “let’s install solar panels it’s a one time investment” ‍‍‍

But how true is that? Let’s check it out 

I used solarrooftop.gov.in/rooftop_calculator to calculate how much I have to spend on installing solar panels above my house by providing the information about the availability of roof space and the state I belong to.

After adding in the govt subsidy, I would have had to pay 3.9 lakh to install solar panels above my roof but if I choose not to install solar panels, then I would have paid 12 lakhs in the next 25 years.

Isn’t that a massive amount of savings? 

And if you want to know more about subsidies, then check out websites like solarrooftop.gov.in or if you are from Karnataka then you can check out, bescom.karnataka.gov.in

It is indeed a great way to make your electricity bill to Rs.0

What do you think about this? Do you have a solar panel above your house? Let me know in the comments section.

There was a time where I used to order food from restaurants every single day and the only thing that could stop me from ordering food was, ‘No Discount’.

Of course I would check multiple apps and check the prices but if there’s no discount in any of the apps, then it was a big NO for me.

I wish I knew Hubble back then, because here you will get guaranteed discounts in 100’s of platforms.

"Which lesson was YOUR highlight?

Bajaj, birla, piramal, goenka, agrawal families all come from here.

I’m talking about marwaris and here are 7 lessons you can learn from them

Income is not salary, it is capital that must be reinvested to grow and multiply
Forget banks, Marwaris have strong networks that enable reputation based lending, family trust systems and informal credit
Who needs an MBA when you’ve been sitting at your fathers shop learning cashflow, risk taking and bargaining since childhood
The real investments are hard assets like land and gold that protect during inflation and crashes and can be passed on
While middle class is spending on cars and vacations, marwaris are frugal, investing the surplus back into the business
Family is not just an emotion, but a strategy to reduced taxes by setting up an HUF or family trust
While middle class wants to pay the loan as fast as possible, marwari treat it like free money if their investments make 12% and the loan charges 8%. So liability becomes leverage

That is the marwari money playbook. Send this to a friend and follow @ishansharma7390 for more.

"THIS WAS INSANE!

We just hosted a 200 people AI hackathon in Mumbai.

Over 1500 people applied for this hackathon.

It was an epic experience having people from around the country, from companies like Google, BlackRock, Swiggy, PwC, Deloitte, from India’s top institutes like IIT Bombay & IIM Bangalore.

We had an amazing series of sessions with people like Himanshu Goel, Udit Goenka, Ipsita Das, Saransh Anand, Ekta DB & Anik Jain.

What followed after was a AI hackathon were over 200 participants used tools like make, lovable, cursor and replit to create ai agents, websites and short ads and submit there hack in a gamma presentation.

The winners were just as interesting as the hackathon concept itself.

1. Sachin won the Macbook Air M4 for creating an ai agent that enables blind people to find volunteers to help them write exams. Helping bridge the gap and create equal access for all.
Sachin was a windows laptop user with a barely useable trackpad. This was his first MacBook.

2. Nagesh won the PS5 for creating a short film showcasing a broke artist using veo3 and nano banana to setup his AI studio, thereby demonstrating the impact AI will have on the ads and production industry.

3. Anjali won the Mac Mini for creating Spendwise, an app that can help you manage your finances. You feed it your previous spends and then ask it if you can make specific purchases and when.
The most striking fact? Anjali has never built a website before, and was using Bolt for the first time.

Not just developers, but CAs, sales managers, video editors, designers, writers and more used AI to build incredible tools and videos. Spanning generations, the youngest participant was 15 and the oldest was 54. There was even an atendee from France who was in Mumbai doing an India tour.

We had soo much fun organising this event and I can’t wait to do another one.

Which city should we go to next?

Home top up loan 

This loan is offered to those who have an existing home loan in a bank.

While some banks have restrictions that top up loans should be only used for home related purposes, most of the banks don’t have such restrictions.

Why should you or your family consider getting a home top up loan instead of a personal loan, education loan or even a home loan.

1. Cheaper interest rates, generally 1% more than your home loan with an additional 1% processing fee.

(Eg. If your home loan is for 10% then your home top up loan will be for somewhere around 11%)

2. Can be used in multiple places, no questions asked.

3. Fast loan approval

4. Tax benefits can be availed if strictly used home related purposes.

So in case there’s a situation where you might have to take any sort of loan like education loan, car loan, personal loan you can think of this option assuming you have a home loan in some bank.

Please do share it with your friends and family, this video could help somebody save a lot of money. Maybe not today, but for sure someday.

Have a great day ❤️

& yes, that’s the college I studied in

"You can help your parents save taxes 

All you have to do is, get involved in your family business and help them do their tasks, basically you would be an employee of the company.

Which means your parents who run the business shall pay you a salary which is shown as an expense for them.

In simple terms, more expense means less profits & less profits means less taxes.

And if the total salary they give you in the whole year is less than 7 lakhs, then you don’t have to pay taxes either under the new tax regime.

Note: You should provide technical/professional service or some sort of value addition to the company. Else your salary might get clubbed with the business income of your parent’s company and they will have no option but to pay taxes.

"Earn passive income with gold 

We Indians love gold, to wear it as an ornament or as an investment.

But a lot of people prefer physical gold than any other options of gold investments like sovereign gold bonds, digital gold etc.

It’s totally up to the individual to choose what’s best for them as it’s a never ending argument to choose which is a better option.

In physical gold, you can put it on yourself and feel that pride in you but might not be the best investment option due to making charges, GST, illiquid etc.

In digital gold, you definitely can’t wear it but it is liquid (easily converted to cash), earns interest, no GST etc.

Let me know in the comments section which option do you prefer.

But in case you choose digital gold, then there’s a new way on how you can earn extra interest on your gold.

 Gold Leasing

The basic process involves leasing your Digital Gold to jewellers. The jewellers hold on to it for a certain time period and use it as part of their daily business.

Throughout the leasing process, you remain the owner of the gold. 

The jewellers are liable to pay you interest for the gold they have borrowed from you.

There are multiple apps where you can buy digital gold and lease it.

The average interest a lot of platforms are providing is 3 - 6% 

For eg. If the gold price goes up by 10% you will get in total for 13 to 16%.

Please note: Digital gold is not regulated by SEBI, but it is run by refineries such as Augmont, which is BIS accredited & a member of Indian gold delivery standard on NSE & BSE.

"I'm NOT CRYING!

Just conducted an hour long AI Masterclass for @cocacola_india here in Guwahati and it was soo much fun!
It's an honor to get to work with one of greatest brands in the world.

I talked about using AI tools like Google Gemini, Veo3, Lovable, NotebookLM, SunoAI & Gamma for brainstorming and creativity while showing all the craziest use cases of them.

This was my first time delivering a talk at a corporate event and of course I was nervous.
But then I reminded myself of the 14 year old version of mine.
10 years ago, I was the most shy and underconfident kid in the class and today after giving 40+ talks in India and abroad, It all felt unreal.

So, I told myself, if I have done all this, why NOT this as well.

So I got ready. Pulled together an epic presentation and went ALL IN.

Had an epic time interacting with the employees at Coca Cola and it was amazing seeing them being soo curious about AI and it's application.

Upwards and onwards.

Excited for tomorrow's talk with Lenovo on AI.

And more coming up!

Thanks for following me on this journey and giving me the confidence to keep hitting above my weight. Still I'm the youngest one in the room. A rule that has changed everything in my life.

"Your parents can help you save money 

If you work from home and stay with your parents/relatives then you won’t be able to claim your HRA exemption and the whole amount you receive will be taxable.

That’s when you can pay rent to your parents and show it to your employer and claim HRA exemption.

Here’s how it is calculated.

Let’s consider a situation where,

1. Annual Basic salary: 3.6 LPA (30k/month)
2. Annual rent: 1.8 Lakh
3. HRA received: 1.8 Lakh

Now the lowest amount among the below 3 conditions will be exempted from Tax.

1. 50% basic salary + DA = 1.8L

2. Rent - (10% of Basic + DA) = 1.44L

3. HRA received= 1.8 L

So the lowest amount among the 3 is 1.44 lakh, which means out of 1.8 lakh HRA you receive, you will only have to pay tax for 36k.

But what if you hadn’t paid rent, then the whole 1.8L would be taxable.

Please note a few important things.

1. You will have to make a proper house agreement with your parents/relatives.

2. You should actually transfer money on a regular basis.

3. The rental amount they receive, only 70% of it will be taxable.

4. This is only applicable if you choose old tax regime.

"Don’t buy gold in Dubai ✈️

I know you are shocked to read that, but in most cases it is the truth.

There may be a price difference but considering situations like high making charges, currency conversion fees, there is hardly any difference.

But of course there are exceptions when the making charges are low and you will eventually save a big chunk of money.

Taking such decisions might be overwhelming, that’s why I decided to give you a FREE TOOL in my newsletter where you can calculate if it is actually worth buying gold in Dubai or not by just putting inputs like the current price of gold and making charges.

Important: I have also mentioned 3 secret ways to save money while buying gold in Dubai. Just go to the link in my bio and subscribe to my newsletter ROB INSIDER to get such exclusive content.

They saved up 4m dollars while working in tech for 15 years and bought a house in Mysore with maids, a driver and get to live near their family.

With rising costs of living, worse US visa policies, and bad job market, many are choosing to come back to live a life of convenience from the money they saved in US

"Wedding insurance 

Marriage is one of the most auspicious events in our lives as it marks the beginning of a new phase.

But not to forget, it comes with a lot of expenditure.

Touch wood, but imagine things go wrong on the wedding day like natural calamities, someone getting sick that day, or damage to the venue or 100s of other reasons, it would make a huge dent on the pockets.

That’s why, there’s wedding insurance which covers all the major costs, just in case the marriage gets cancelled due to legitimate reasons.

 According to Union Health Ministry officials, e-Sanjeevani “has democratised access to quality healthcare, reaching the last mile.” Andhra Pradesh leads with over 6 crore consultations, while more than 56% of users are women. Its dual models assisted consultations through community health officers and direct patient-doctor video calls ensure inclusivity.

"Did you know this? 

This is called loan restructuring.

This was introduced in a situation where borrowers like us are not able to cope up with the high interest rate of the bank loans due to several situations like health issues, job loss etc.

So you can ask your banks for loan restructuring, this may not be the best option but it is much better than not paying your EMIs or defaulting the loan as it can affect your credit score drastically.

In fact, even banks don’t want you to default the loan or not pay the EMIs, hence they will also be generous enough to help you in restructuring your loan.

Talking about restructuring, it could happen in multiple ways.

Either you can increase the loan tenure (No. Of years), due to which the monthly EMI amount will reduce.

Or you can ask for the moratorium of the EMI payments, which means you might get a few months break from paying your EMIs. But please note, here the interest amount will continue to add up, just that you don’t have to pay EMIs for a few months.

Or you could convert your personal loan which is an unsecured loan to secured loan by giving collateral to banks such as gold, house, car etc. due to which the interest rate will slightly decrease because banks love secured loans as there is high amount of trust and very low chance of defaulting the loan.

If you are going through a hard time, you can request your bank manager for loan restructuring and they will definitely help you out.

"Did you know this?

Before we jump into the conclusion let me explain to you that there are 2 types of loan, secured loan and unsecured loan.

Secured loan means, we have to give some sort of collateral to the banks to get loans from them.

Unsecured loans mean, we don’t have to give any sort of collateral to get loans from the banks.

And banks love secured loan than anything else. That’s why the approval time & the interest rates are much lower compared to unsecured loans.

So whenever you are taking a loan, please go for a secured loan instead of an unsecured loan, because having a secured loan will mean that you are a trust worthy borrower & in turn your credit score will improve.

So there’s this unsaid rule that, if you keep the ratio of secured loan to unsecured loan in 80 to 20 ratio, your credit score will generally improve.

Note: Examples of secured loans are, gold loan, home loan etc.

Examples of unsecured loans are, personal loan, student loan, credit card loan etc.

Please share it with your friends, this video could probably help them improve their credit score and get loans at a cheaper interest rate.

"Up to 50% discount on car insurance 

No claim bonus certificate is given to you as a reward for not using your insurance for at least 1 year to 5 years.

If you don’t use your insurance for 5 years, you will get up to 50% discount while renewing your car insurance.

Also note, you will get somewhere around 20% for the first year of not using your insurance, 25% on 2nd year, 35% on 3rd year & 45% on 4th year. Please note that, this percentage may change based on different circumstances.

Let’s assume you have not used your insurance for 3 years and you are going to get a discount of somewhere around 35% which is significantly a huge amount.

But all of the sudden, your car might get slightly damaged, it would cost you somewhere around 3k for the repair.

Now you have 2 options, either claim your insurance and not get the NCB benefit (which might be a bad option)

Or pay 3k yourself.

If you can’t decide which one to go for & your vehicle keeps getting damaged slightly, then you should go for No claim bonus protection cover, which will cost only 0.5% of the whole insurance premium amount because of which, even if you use insurance, your NCB will still remain intact and can be used to avail discount.

What do you think about this insurance add on?

Share it with your friends & family, you never know, this video could help somebody save a lot of money.

Moreover, it can also be a burden on your pockets as you will have to pay a separate and higher premium for each of your policies.

"Interest free education loan ✅

Central sector interest subsidy (CSIS) is a unique govt scheme for students to support them and pursue their education based on their economic condition.

The vison of this scheme is to support students who are denied to get admission into colleges due to low family income.

So if you are planning to take an education loan, then the government will pay an interest amount for your education loan till you complete your education + 1 additional year.

Eg: engineering is a 4 year course, which means, govt will pay the interest amount of your education loan for 5 years.

Please note, subsidy will be only provided for 10 lakh rupees irrespective of the sanctioned loan amount.

You are eligible for this subsidy only if the annual income of your family is below 4.5 lakh rupees.

You can apply for this subsidy in Jansamarth.in 

Please share it with your friends, if you feel they can be benefited with this govt scheme.

"Rent vs buying a house 

It’s an endless argument regarding this topic and I personally feel it is very subjective and don’t want to dig deep into it.

But I just want to answer/clarify arguments from both ends.

Benefits of renting a house 

1. Low maintenance cost
2. Suitable for individuals who keep shifting to new cities very often
3. Requires less capital
4. Can upgrade or downgrade your lifestyle easily etc.

Benefits of owning a house 

1. No landlord hassle
2. Emotional security
3. Tax benefits on home loan
4. Induced saving (forced saving) etc.

So I let you guys decide which would be a better option for you guys 

But if you are planning to buy properties for only investment purposes, then there are also great options like, commercial properties & Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).

I’ll definitely make a separate individual videos on these topics real soon 

But what do you think? Which one is a better option? Buying, renting or investing in REITs?

"Comment ‘CAR’ and I’ll send you the link straight into your DMs!

 Why buying second-hand cars often makes way more sense than going new.

If you’re making ₹20L a year (₹1.25L/month), you shouldn’t be spending more than ₹12K–15K/month on EMIs. That means you’re looking at a new car worth around ₹8–10L.

But step into the used car market  and the same budget gets you way better value.
Example: Instead of a brand-new Celerio, you could buy a 2015 Honda City for just ₹3L — and enjoy 5 more years of solid driving.

Even if you’re making ₹1 crore a year, the math doesn’t change. Cars are depreciating assets. A shiny ₹70L Mercedes may look tempting, but financially? A smartly picked second-hand car still wins.

 Bottom line: Second-hand lets you punch above your weight without burning cash on depreciation.

Would you go second-hand over new? Comment below

Yeah… forever bad investments. 

Diamonds: 2–3% CAGR → even fell 25% in the last 5 years.
Gold: 8–9% CAGR → keeps compounding like that one overachiever in your WhatsApp group.

So if you spend ₹20L on diamonds, you’ll have ~₹27L after 10 years.
But the ₹15L gold necklace? That’ll be worth ~₹33L.

"✅Here are the benefits of taking a home loan in your wife’s name:

	1.	Lower Interest Rates: Many banks offer reduced interest rates for women borrowers, typically 0.05% to 0.1% lower, resulting in long-term savings.

	2.	Tax Benefits: If your wife is a co-owner and co-applicant, both spouses can claim tax deductions:
	•	Under Section 80C: Up to ₹1.5 lakh each on principal repayment.
	•	Under Section 24(b): Up to ₹2 lakh each on interest payment for self-occupied properties.

	3.	Stamp Duty Concessions: Some states offer reduced stamp duty rates (1-2%) for properties registered in a woman’s name, lowering the overall cost.

	4.	Improved Loan Eligibility: Applying for a joint loan, considering both incomes, increases the loan eligibility and approval chances.

	5.	Women-Specific Schemes: Women homeowners may benefit from government schemes or subsidies aimed at promoting female property ownership.

	6.	Legal Security and Empowerment: Registering property in your wife’s name gives her legal ownership, promoting financial security and gender equality within the family.

By leveraging these benefits, you can save on costs and secure better terms while empowering women through homeownership.

"Is Indian currency losing its value?

Technically yes, but it is doing much better compared to other currencies. I totally agree with our finance minister when she said, “Rupee is not weakening, Dollar is getting stronger” which is technically right because looking at the stats, the major world currencies like Yes, Pound, Won, Euros have lost their value by 30%, 23.2%, 21% & 19.7% respectively against the USD in the last year but India has only lost its value by 9.83%.

The best part is, when we compare world’s major currency’s performance against Indian Rupee, INR’s value has increased against the Japanese Yen, Pound, South Korean won, and Euro by 16%, 10%, 9.5% & 7.9% respectively.

which is really great news that the Indian rupee has been performing well against most countries.

But if you want to get benefitted from the dollar rate increasing at a massive speed, then either you have to earn in dollars by working for a US company or investing in US stocks, or just holding dollars.

But should you invest in US stocks? It is really subjective but if you decide to invest, you will not only get exposure to some of the top US companies but you will also be benefitted from the price appreciation of the US Dollar.

Isn’t that amazing? So if you are planning to invest in US stocks, European stocks or even commodities, download the Vantage app from the LINK IN MY BIO which is an All-in-one trading platform.

"I tried world’s most expensive coffee, ₹50,000/kg coffee 

Kopi Luwak is the world’s most exclusive (and most expensive) coffee. The main factor of its high price is the uncommon method of production. It is produced from coffee beans which have been partially digested by the Indonesian palm civet and then excreted. Yes, it sounds kind of gross, but not to worry! The outer layer of the coffee bean is removed during processing and the remaining beans are completely cleaned before being roasted and sent to you. 

 It is noticeably not bitter and is intensely aromatic. It has a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate.

2. Potential Investments: If the interest rate on the loan is low, you might invest the difference and earn a higher return than the loan interest rate, just like I invested them in mutual funds

Do you know the hottest job of 2025?

This was the job satya nadella and sundar pichai did before they became CEOs

And in a world where coding and design is getting replaced by AI, this role is more important than ever before. With an average salary of 17 lakhs

I’m talking about Product Management.

You are responsible for turning customer insights into actionable steps for where the product should go and you get to own the business outcome of the product.

While 31% of PMs come from business backgrounds and 23% from engineering, it is clear you don’t need to be always technical.

AI tools like gpt-4, lovable, figma and uizard make it super easy for you to experiment what the customer wants. But the true skill of a PM today lies in figuring out what metric to optimise on, what to test on and how to interpret results.

Every 20 something i met in new york was doing a degree in product management.

Debit card accidental death insurance 

Most of the debit cards have this insurance & a lot of people are not even aware of it. I’m pretty sure, it is there in your debit card too. Consider checking it out.

Some premium debit cards also provide Air accident death cover ✈️

The insurance cover varies from ₹10,000 to ₹20,00,000 depending on the debit card and the accidental situation.

But there are a few conditions, the insurance cover is only valid when the card has been used at least once in 30-90 days.

And for Air accidental insurance to be valid, the ticket should be booked using that debit card itself (the conditions may vary)

I hope this reel was useful, comment down below which debit card do you own

"If you are a student, save this video 

Getting a educational loan can be a lot of hassle, you might have to go to banks multiple times, get quotations from college about your fees, and so many other formalities.

And if you are about to take an educational loan, it’s highly possible to go and approach multiple banks to compare their interest rates.

That’s why, govt. has launched this platform www.Vidyalaxmi.co.in where you can apply through online mode itself.

Here, if you put in all the required details, they will show you which all banks can provide you the loan & they will also compare multiple banks to give you the best interest rates possible.

This is applicable for education in India and abroad as well.

In fact you can apply through this portal and get all the application status on this portal itself. 

This is such a great initiative, and your friends need to know this.

"Cars are taxed based on their length & size of the engine.

The GST & compensation cess is different for different categories of cars.

If you are planning to buy a petrol car, then please pause or save the video to check from the table on how much tax you would pay based on engine size (CC) and length of the car.

And same goes with diesel cars. I know for a fact that, a lot of people wouldn’t worry much about the length but if you are confused between 2 vehicles & there’s a length difference of engine size difference which can help you save money, then why not.

Note: compensation cess is calculated on the price of the notified goods before GST (& not on the tax amount)

So conclusion, Size does matter

"3 secret ways to save money while buying new cars  

The next 3 secrets are,

1. Extended warranty hack 

When you are buying an extended warranty for your car which is generally 1% of the total car price, you will be given with 2 options:

5 years, ~1.2 lakh KM. (Or)
5 years, Unlimited KM.

Go for 1.2 lakh KM because this will generally save you around 5 to 10k rupees.

2. Car Loan discount 

If you decide to finance your car or take loan from the dealer itself, then please rethink your decision because generally they take commission of around 0.5 to 1.5%. You either negotiate with them to reduce the interest rates or take it from banks itself.

3.  Accessories hack 

This is the part where car dealers make the money from, major chuck of profits come from accessories itself. But I highly suggest, if you are deciding to modify, only electric and chrome modifications would be suggested because to maintain quality and to avoid insurance claim getting rejected. It is suggested to make other modifications from after market places/ private modifiers where you can get it for much cheaper price and of similar quality. 

Please note: quality can’t be promised in private garages, you will have to take some bold decisions in this matter.

"Convert peanut butter in diamonds 

Before that let’s talk if diamonds are actually worth buying?

To answer this, the story goes back to 1888, where De beers (A company) controlled 85% of the total diamonds in the world. So they used to decide on how much diamonds should be released into the market & what shall be it’s price.

The problem arises when, the diamonds were started to be made in laboratories, De Beers were badly hit & they had to launch a marketing campaign where it says, “Diamonds are forever” symbolising love and affection, it went to a point where people were told, bigger the diamond, more the love for your partner & that’s when the price of diamonds sky rocketed.

But in reality, there are too many diamonds making them not rare at all. And naturally it’s price has to go down with time.

In fact, as soon as you buy a diamond, it’s value drops by 50% making it a very bad investment.

Now talking about lab grown diamonds, we cannot make out any difference in them with our naked eye & it’s almost similar in their molecular structure as well & this was achieved by subjecting the diamond into high temperature & pressure which is similar to earths mantle.

And because peanut butter was rich in carbon, it was successfully converted into diamonds

"Is apple care worth it?

Generally when we buy any apple product, we will get default warranty which will cover all the manufacturing defects for upto 1 year.

But any other damages like screen breakage, software crash or battery damage, it won’t be covered until you buy an Apple care which acts like an insurance.

I personally have an iPhone 13 & the apple care would have costed me ₹17,900.

Let’s assume I have bought it & now my screen is broken, will I be able to get it repaired for free?

Nope, I’ll have to pay additional service charge of ₹2,500.

Technically you are paying ₹17,900 + ₹2,500 = ₹20,400.

But if I had to get the screen replaced without apple care it would have costed me nearly ₹16,000 or if I was okay with putting a local screen, it would cost me somewhere around ₹6,000 to ₹7,000.

So I guess, I’m my opinion, it’s not worth buying an apple care until you have a very bad history of breaking phones multiple times.

What are your thoughts? I would love to hear that.

"You will lose lakhs of Rupees 

When you buy a car/bike by taking a loan, banks are actually the owners of the vehicle until we completely repay all the EMIs, this is basically called as hypothecation.

But as soon as you repay your loan completely, don’t forget to take the No objection certificate (NOC) from the bank, which is the proof that you have completely repaid your loan.

If you don’t take NOC then the vehicle loan will still be considered active in your credit report and it will affect your credit score.

Also, if you don’t have NOC you can’t even sell your car to anyone else, because technically you can’t sell what you don’t own.

You can apply for NOC from Parivahan.gov.in

Please share it with your friends who own a vehicle & make them aware about this concept, by this way, they will be benefitted & will also make you look a little cool in front of them

Indian graduates are jobless and this is a wake up call for all of us
83% of engineering graduates
46% of mba grads from 2024 still dont have a job!

There are 3 big reasons behind it

1. Lack of common sense: most people memorise concepts, but never learn how to think critically, and are frozen the moment they get a new question. Learn to breakdown a problem and approach it step by step with logic.

2. Lack of options: if youre just applying on job portals, youre doing it wrong. You need to reachout to companies big and small and learn to sell yourself. You can find their emails from apollo and get that first meeting

3. Lack of communication skills: theres no turn off than a candidate who cannot articulate their thoughts and speak with clarity. It signals low confidence and a bad team player. Thats the last thing recruiters want.

"To all the Dog  /cat  lovers.

Post covid, a lot of people have started to adopt pets & that’s really amazing.

But looking from financial perspective, it comes with a lot of expense be it vaccinations, certification, hospitalisation expense & even dog tax (recently).

So few people couldn’t bare it & that’s the reason we saw a lot of pets being abandoned. To stop this, insurance companies have come up with pet insurance starting with just ₹350 to cover your pet’s major expenses so it doesn’t become burden to the owners.

Even though you can afford all the costs, it’s better to insure your pets as they are a part of our family.

Note: A very few companies are providing this insurance & I have mentioned the names of it in the video, do check them out.

Also, this is not a financial advice & it is only for educational purposes only.

2 New Cars: Car prices are also climbing, leading to challenges in affording new vehicles.

3. Vacations: Funds once allocated for trips are now being redirected to cover rising home costs and necessities.

4 Healthcare: Even with work-provided healthcare, expenses are significant, impacting budgets.

5. Private School/ Tuition classes : While it’s not essential for everyone, it’s a desirable option for maximum families as both parents are working these days. Rising fees of tuitions is becoming a problem for many. 

Now how to overcome it

If you are planning to buy a car and you are under the age 25, it’s better if you buy a car in your dad’s name because while you are buying a car insurance, you will get it for much cheaper price Because generally dads will have more driving experience than we do, so there’s less risk when they are driving the car.

Now the question arises, won’t it be a problem if I use the car? As far as it’s not a commercial vehicle, anybody can drive the car but there’s a catch, if I am not added as Named driver/paid driver, insurance claim can get rejected.

"Save this video to Save LAKHS in future ✅

What is depreciation? Sounds complicated right?

In simple words, we all know that the value of the car decreases with time right. For eg, I bought an eco sport 9 years ago for 11 lakhs now it’s worth Max to max 4 to 5 lakhs.

Why is that? It is because of depreciation.

Due to general wear and tear happening with the car, the value of each parts falls, due to which the value of whole cars go down.

Generally, after 5 years of buying the car, it’s value decreases by 50%.

Let’s assume you bought a car for 10 lakhs 5 years ago, now it’s worth 5 lakhs. 

(Touchwood) but let’s just say your car gets stolen & what do you think, insurance company will pay you 10 lakhs or 5 lakhs? 

It’s gonna be only 5 lakhs because that’s what your car was actually worth right.

But if you had bought depreciation cover as an add on by only paying 15% more premium, you would have got total 10 lakhs from the insurance company.

This applies for individual parts of the car as well. So it is always suggested to take depreciation cover as well.

Also I’m just curious, which bike/car do you own? Let me know in the comment section

"Pay as you drive insurance ✅

Sounds fancy right? So it’s basically designed for those people who don’t use their car much often for various reasons.

So if you drive less, the chances of getting into an accident is much less.

So pay as you drive insurance will only help you reduce 10% of Own Damage insurance premium but adding telematics to your car will also track the way you drive, be it how fast you ride, how often you ride etc. By this way, insurance companies will have a clear idea on how safe a driver you are and it will also help them give an exact quote of insurance premium.

So for some reason, you don’t use your car much often, or if you have multiple cars, then you should definitely mention this to your insurance company and go for pay as you drive insurance.

Note: this is only applicable if you drive less than 15,000km/year.

Also this is not any financial advice, this is only for educational purposes.

"What if you could actually profit from a car loan instead of losing money to interest?

Sounds fake — but here’s how savvy buyers are doing it 

Instead of taking a used car loan at 14–16% interest, some buyers create a ₹20 lakh Fixed Deposit under a senior citizen parent’s name (to earn higher FD rates).

They then take a loan against that FD at ~8.5% and use it to buy a ₹17L second-hand car (like a Honda City).

Over 3 years:
▪️ Interest paid on the loan ≈ ₹2.5 lakh
▪️ Interest earned on the FD ≈ ₹4 lakh+

Net result → ₹1.5 lakh profit while driving the car.

Bonus Hack:
After ~1.5 years, once credit score & income have improved, refinance the loan to a cheaper bank (via platforms like PolicyBazaar), pay foreclosure + processing, and drop the interest rate even further.

This is not just buying a car.
It’s financial engineering on wheels.

Here’s the catch: the same top-tier policy with all add-ons can cost only ₹40k–₹60k online .

 Why buying second-hand cars often makes way more sense than going new.

If you’re making ₹20L a year (₹1.25L/month), you shouldn’t be spending more than ₹12K–15K/month on EMIs. That means you’re looking at a new car worth around ₹8–10L.

But step into the used car market  and the same budget gets you way better value.
Example: Instead of a brand-new Celerio, you could buy a 2015 Honda City for just ₹3L — and enjoy 5 more years of solid driving.

Even if you’re making ₹1 crore a year, the math doesn’t change. Cars are depreciating assets. A shiny ₹70L Mercedes may look tempting, but financially? A smartly picked second-hand car still wins.

 Bottom line: Second-hand lets you punch above your weight without burning cash on depreciation.

Whenever you take a loan from bank, you keep something called as collateral for eg, you car, house etc. 

Now let’s assume you can’t repay your loan, banks will come and seize your car or house.

Of course they can’t take your car home right, so they will auction your car at a much cheaper price in various places.

Nowadays E auctions also take place and one of the free websites are Eauctionsindia.com

Just go to this website, choose the preferred date & bank. There you will be given with multiple car options, where for you to take part in the auction you will have to pay at least 10% of the auction price to the bank details mentioned there, don’t worry it’s refundable.

Solar Panels are becoming increasingly popular in India because of the benefits they provide. Few people in my colony are getting ZERO ELECTRICITY BILLS after installing solar panels!! Butone of the problems faced is the installation cost of the same.

To solve just this, the government has launched the Har Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana which is a welcome move!

How to apply for PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yoiana?

Visit the official website of PM Suryaghar:
pmsuryaghar.gov.in
Click on Apply for Rooftop Solar 
In the next step, people need to register themselves by entering details like State, District, Consumer Account Number, and Electricity Distribution Company.
Then select the option to apply for the Rooftop Solar as per the form.
Now, applicants have to wait for the feasibility approval from DISCOM. Only those who have received approval from DISCOM can install the plant by any of the registered vendors in your DISCOM.
Once installation is over, submit the plant details and apply for a net meter.
After the installation of the het meter and inspection by DISCOM, people will generate a commissioning certificate from the portal.
After receiving the commissioning report, people have to submit the bank account details and a cancelled cheque through the portal to receive a subsidy within 30 days.

“In order to further sustainable development and people’s wellbeing, we are launching the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana. This project, with an investment of over Rs. 75,000 crores aims to light up 1 crore households by providing up to 300 units of free electricity every month.” - PM Narendra Modi

Owning a luxury car is 5x cheaper than renting one 

@proratacar allows you to co-own a luxury car and drive it for 30 days a year for five years. You only pay 8.33% of the on-road price of the car (one-time payment) + annual maintenance charges. If you do the math, you can co-own a Mercedes GLC worth 90 lahks at just 7.5 lakhs 
Yes, you heard that right! Owning brand-new luxury cars is now easy, cheap, and profitable 

1️⃣ Easy - You drive, and Prorata takes care of everything, be it road tax, insurance, or maintenance. (Fuel price is managed by the co-owners, whereas challans will be allocated to the co-owner driving the car in that period) 

2️⃣ Cheap - Co-owning a brand-new luxury car costs 8.33% of the car’s on-road price. 

3️⃣ Profitable - Co-owning a luxury car with Prorata is like buying shares. Prorata creates an LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) of 4-12 co-owners from a residential society and purchases the car in the name of that LLP. If you buy one ticket (ownership share), you are an 8.33% partner of that LLP. After 5 years, Prorata will sell the car and distribute the amount among the LLP members The company says you will receive 40-60% of your investment back after five years.

"Loosing a car key was not a big deal back in the times, but now after so much advancement, the car key has become so expensive. So it’s better we take a car key cover add on which would only cost us ₹200 to ₹300 more.

Getting a duplicate key for a random mechanic shop is much riskier because the mechanic could have the security code for your key and could easily rob your car.

Which is very risky, that’s why insurance companies won’t pay you a single penny until you submit both your original keys.

Also your claim may be denied if you think you can scam the insurance companies by providing them fake keys.

"Car depreciation is the difference in the value of the car between the time it was purchased & when it was sold.

Every car depreciates with time due to natural wear and tear.

This is the average depreciation rate.

0 - 6 months: 5%
6 months - 1 year: 15%
1 year - 2 years: 20%
2 years - 3 years: 30%
3 years - 4 years: 40%
4 years to 5 years: 50%

Above 5 years: Mutually decided between the insurer & vehicle owner.

So after speaking to a car reseller, they told me that it is better to buy a car which is somewhere around 5 years old and sell it within 2 years. 

By this, there won’t be any significant depreciation and you get somewhat the same price as what you bought.

Note: this is not any financial advice, it is only for educational purposes.

"“Doctor a day, keeps an Apple away”

Always check whether your health insurance has a room rent limit or not. It’s always suggested to get an insurance without any such limit because there is something called as ‘PROPORTIONATE DEDUCTION’ 

For eg, if your insurance is of ₹3 lakh & the room rent limit will be 0.1% of 3,00,000 ie. ₹3,000.

Assume your bill is ₹90,000

If you are admitted in a hospital room which has a rent of ₹9,000, then the insurance won’t pay your complete bill because you used 3 times the room rent limit.

Now, insurance company will deduct
1. Cost of pharmacy 
2. Cost of implant & medical device
3. Cost of diagnostics

From that ₹90,000 & divide the remaining amount by 3, because you spent 3 times the room rent limit.

I know it’s a lot of head ache, so please choose an insurance without any room rent limit.

Hope you liked the quote of the day ❤️

"Wait for it 

According to section 157 of the motor vehicle act, 1988, the pets who has purchased the second hand car should transfer the car insurance policy within 14days.

The law states that, it is responsibility of the new owner to initiate the transfer process.

However if the new car owner is not bothered, then it is the responsibility of the previous owner to remind him/her to initiate the transfer process to avoid any legal or monetary trouble in the future.

"No Claim Bonus is considered as proof of being a responsible driver and maintaining a good condition of the insured car. Thus, the policyholder can earn rewards in the form of NCB by not making any claims during his previous policy tenure.

The No Claim Bonus helps a policyholder to earn at least 20% and upto 50% discount on his car insurance premium. For every claim-free year, the NCB discount percentage is granted to the policyholder. This discount can be used to reduce the premium amount that he is supposed to pay at the time of renewing his car insurance.

"EPF or Employee’s Provident Fund is a government-approved retirement benefits scheme available to eligible salaried individuals employed in India.

Employer’s Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) allows employees to partially withdraw money from their PF accounts and use it as a personal loan to deal with emergency situations. While this is often referred to as an EPF Loan it is not exactly a loan but actually an advance as the amount withdrawn does not have to be paid back (non-refundable) in most cases (unlike in case of a personal loan).

It can be used for marriage, education, purchase of home, medical treatment, home loan payment etc.

The interest rate falls to somewhere around 8.5% interest & generally lesser than personal loan.

Share it with your friends who are in need of money for emergency.

Note: The EPFO member must have completed at least 7 years of service.

"Do you AGREE?

This is Dior Cafe, last week I was at Louis Vuitton Cafe and Ralph Lauren’s coffee

But why are luxury brands opening cafes all of a sudden?

Experiential Branding
Cafes allow brands to create unique, in-person experiences that go beyond just selling products. Customers can “step into” the brand’s world surrounded by signature design elements, colors, and motifs which deepens loyalty.

Accessible Luxury
While luxury goods may be out of reach for many, a coffee or pastry at a designer cafe offers a more affordable way for consumers, especially Millennials and Gen Z

Social Media
These visually striking spaces are designed for Instagram and other social platforms, generating organic buzz and making the brand more culturally relevant.

Floating interest rate means the rate of interest is subject to revision every quarter. The interest will be pegged to base rate determined by the RBI based on various economic factors.

Im in the Royal Institute London, where the most iconic science lectures were conducted.

- Michael faraday inventing the motor and discovering laws of electromagnetism

- Thomson announcing the existence of an electron

And Carl Sagan simplifying cosmos and earth for the masses

What made these speeches truly remarkable was 3 things:

1. Keep it stupid simple: the sign of a great orator is how they simplify the most complex topics for anyone to understand and remember

2. Show more than you speak: people remember visuals more than what they hear and using visual cues, mini-drama body language, tone and pitch matters a lot

3. Engage with the audience, they best speakers take the audience on a story, a journey where they feel involved connected emotionally and intellectually.

I asked chatgpt: show me the ugliest truths about me and my personality from what you know, what masks am i wearing, what are my blind spots, point out exact instances that relate with it and suggest ways to improve

I was shocked by how much chatgpt knows about me

It remembers little details I might have mentioned before and analyses my behavior based on it very well.

But the best part is where it helps you improve, suggesting ways to let go of the bad habits. I built a daily tracker of sorts, where i report to it what i did today and how i’m improving.

Super useful, try it if you haven’t already

"Difference between flat interest rate & Reducing Interest rate.

Let’s say you take a loan for ₹5,00,000 at 10% interest for 10 years.

- With Flat Interest Rate

Monthly EMI - ₹8,333
Total interest - ₹5,00,000
Total Amount - ₹10,00,000

- Reducing Interest Rate

Monthly EMI - ₹6,608
Total interest - ₹2,92,904
Total Amount - ₹7,92,904

You will save ₹2,07,096 with reducing balance interest rate.

Flat interest rate means, the interest rate will be same throughout the year & it will be calculated on the principal amount ie, ₹5,00,000

Reducing balance interest rate means the interest will be calculated in the outstanding amount of the loan, which keeps decreasing as you repay your EMI.

You get the close, minimise, fullscreen buttons like on the mac

A preview app for all things PDF

And menu options on any app you use

You can export videos in the background while using any other app

Chose audio source manually, record studio quality audio from airpods

And much more

"IS IT WORTH IT?

Have you seen founders and creators wear this black band?

It’s literally everywhere!

So I tried it for a week and was blown by the genius behind the 4 billion dollar whoop company

Here’s 3 things you need to know:

The band is actually free: but you pay a yearly subscription for it. At 200 dollars a year, you subscribe to whoop, but you don’t pay for the band. There’s 1.3L indians on whoop already, so that’s 26 million dollars and India isn’t even their focus.
Insights over data: every fitness band can tell you the calories you’re burning, your heart rate, but whoop literally gives me actionable insights every day, measuring how much strain and stress i’m putting on my body and how much rest i need to recover
It’s all about social: i got this band, coz my friend had it and wanted to make me a whoop buddy. Now we are part of a group and we compete who has more strain, better recovery and sleep. Yesterday i slept for 8hrs after years. I run more often coz i want to be number 1 in our group 

My friend calls it “unhealthy health competition” but i love it.

Do you think it’s worth it?

Would you pay 18,000rs per year for whoop?

"Do YOU Agree?

AI is rotting your brain and let me tell you why

You have a decision to make in life
You’re relationship is going south.
So you go to chatgpt and ask for help.

70% of people agree what chatgpt tells them.

Not knowing, that chatgpt cannot think.

It simply predicts the next word in the sentence.

That’s it. It has no idea of your personal context.

It sounds confident, when it could simply be making things up and you wouldn’t know.

Instead of arguing with your thinking, it always agrees with you.

It is a reflection of your thinking wrapped up with pretty words.

It builds an echo chamber where you are always right
And your critical thinking goes down the drain.
You stop questioning, you stop researching, you stop thinking deeply

use AI as a thinking partner but don’t let it takeover your thinking, 
Question everything you see online. Verify sources. Talk to real people. Seek opposite thinking.

And send this to a friend who needs to hear this.

If you search chatgpt on google, observe the first few ad links

See something odd about them?

chatbotapp.ai

chatlyai.app

These are websites pretending to look like chatgpt

With the same colors, same layout and a very similar logo

Most people click the first link and use it thinking it’s chatgpt

These sites then ask users to pay for chatgpt plus

While giving you worse responses than even the free version of chatgpt and rate limits you after sometime

Pocketing the money by misleading innocent people.

They bid the highest in google ads to come at the top of search for a keyword and look very similar to confuse users.

"What do YOU think?

Imagine you meet 3 girls on a first date

And you have to pick one

The only condition is
If you pass an option, you cannot come back to it.

So how do you pick the right one?

Take a minute and tell me in the comments

Well picking the first one is no better than random selection since you’ve not met anyone else

If you get to the third, you are stuck with it and lack the freedom

Hence the second option is your best bet, giving you both information and freedom

If they are better than the first one, chose them
If they’re worse, you still have a 50% chance of the 3rd one being better

With 5 choices, pick after 2
10 choices pick after 3
50 choices pick after 18

Picking after you analyse 37% of your options is the best bet

It’s called optimal stopping and can be applied to any decision in life with multiple choices.

Lakhs of engineering students graduate every year, but less than 1% get packages above 50 LPA. Most colleges struggle with placement rates of 40-60%.

Woxsen University of Hyderabad changes the game completely.

They focus on selective admissions, offering industry-relevant specializations like AI/ML, blockchain, and cybersecurity. 

Plus, you can get hands-on training in advanced labs.

"Pay your 25 year home loan in just 10 years!! Do these simple steps 

✅EMIs should be increased every year in line with the increase in income. This can dramatically reduce the loan tenure. A 25-year loan can be finished off in 10 years if the EMI is increased by 10% every year.

✅If you want to reply the loan in 13 years then you will have to increase your EMI by 5% every year. This would be a convenient option for most as the marginal increase wouldn’t affect the income. 

✅If you want to reduce it to 20 years, then pay 1 EKI extra every year. This would ensure that your loan tenure goes down and also acts as a pocket friendly option for many people as paying an extra EMI in a year might not cause much disturbance to the budget.

If you feel the credit card is of no use and the annual fees has become a burden to you, then you might consider cancelling your credit card.

But here is the problem, if you cancel your CC, your credit score will be affected, if it is your old credit card, then it will be drastically affected.

Here’s what you can do, instead downgrade your credit card to a free credit card,

For eg. if you have a HDFC millennia CC which has ₹1,000 annual fees, then you can downgrade it to HDFC VISA Signature credit card which has ₹0 annual fees, by this way, you didn’t have to cancel your CC & your credit score is fresh like never before.

Under this scheme, every passenger that buys a train ticket is automatically enrolled in a lottery, where one winner is announced every day for a ₹10,000 cash prize, and one weekly winner gets ₹50,000.
The only thing that matters? Your ticket number.
The winning ticket number is updated daily on the website for the passengers to check and claim.
Will this be enough for people to buy tickets?
What do you think?

"️ India’s real estate boom is pricing Indians out of homes.
What we’re building today isn’t housing — it’s speculation.

Let me explain:

1️⃣ Mumbai
– Flats in Worli & Bandra now sell for ₹80,000–₹2.5 lakh per sq. ft.
– But most remain vacant.
– Owned by investors who never live there.
– Supply exists, but it’s locked away from real people.

2️⃣ Gurgaon
– Super-luxury towers like DLF Camellias are selling at ₹100 Cr+.
– These are 2nd, 3rd, even 4th homes.
– Local incomes can’t keep up = locals pushed out.
– Empty towers dominate the skyline.

3️⃣ Hyderabad
– Was once affordable. But FOMO & easy credit inflated prices.
– Builders overbuilt. Demand collapsed.
– Resale prices dropped 15–30% in parts.
– Govt had to freeze new permissions.

Across metros, the pattern is the same:
 High prices, low occupancy, distorted demand.

But here’s the twist…

 Monaco — one of the richest places in the world — doesn’t allow this nonsense.

✅ You need to live in your house at least 6 months/year.
✅ Utilities & taxes are tracked to prevent idle assets.
✅ No proof of residency = no ownership.
✅ Wealth is filtered via deposits in Monaco banks.

Result?
– No ghost towers.
– No speculative frenzy.
– Locals aren’t priced out of their own city.

 Policy India needs (inspired by Monaco & others):
	1.	Vacancy Tax – Tax unused homes after 12 months.
	2.	Occupancy Declaration – Yearly audit of home use.
	3.	Higher Stamp Duty for Investors – Like in Hong Kong.
	4.	Builder Licensing Caps – Stop approvals in oversupplied markets.
	5.	Minimum Holding Periods – Higher tax if you flip in <3 years.

️ India’s goal should be to build homes, not hollow assets.
Otherwise, we’ll keep creating wealth traps, not wealth creators.",Sharan Hegde,financewithsharan,https://www.instagram.com/p/DMszxV4Ifl5/,2025-07-29T17:34:51.000Z,"1. Wealth, Tax & Hidden Systems of the Rich"

"THIS was INSANE!

I made a 20min video detailing how to network with anyone you want. Comment ""networking"" to get the link.

Recently, microsoft flew me on the most expensive airplane seat in the world.

Bengaluru to Seattle and back. Celebrating 50 years of microsoft in seattle was an insane experience. Seeing Bill Gates, Satya Nadella and Steve Ballmer IRL was unreal.

This is the 10Lakh rupees Emirates first class experience.

Apart from the private suite, Bvlgari perfume, extensive meals and dessert, comfort bed, spacious cabin, what truly blew my mind was taking a 5 mins shower at 40,000 ft in the air and the exclusive Emirates bar where you can have drinks with the richest 1%.

This is what I call an asymmetric opportunity.

This is where world’s biggest founders and CEO would hang. And you’re one chat away from getting your next job, freelance client, podcast guest or a new friend.

All you need is a smile on your face, a curios mind and a skill to wow anyone on the first meeting.

Master your one minute pitch. Ask questions, be humorous, make them remember you.

This simple hack has taken me places I could never imagine as a 23 year old.

"Pasta Bolaganesh joke is from my favourite YouTube channel @thejordindian 

Delboeuf Illusion is generally a illusion created by our mind & restaurants use this to trick us to eat less and feel more full.

Assume there are 2 plates, one is larger & other is smaller one, now let’s also assume that there is same amount of food on both the plates.

Still we will feel that smaller plate has more food than the larger one. It is because we tend to decide the amount of food by the distance from the edge of the plate to the food, lesser it is, more food we assume.

So Restaurants generally decrease the plate & spoon size to make us feel that they have served more food than we needed.

It is generally seen in restaurants with unlimited buffet model.

Happy Eating

"A lot of fuel pumps scam you by integrating chips in their fuel machine where you get upto 3% less fuel when you ask them to put the fuel for pre determined numbers like ₹100, ₹200 ₹500, ₹1000 etc.

That’s why it is suggested to put fuel for something close the number you want, like ₹999, ₹510 etc.

"This is CRAZY?!

I’m flying to America not to study abroad, but to build my network and get freelance clients.

Hi I’m Ishan, a 23 yr old running a content company and people pay crores for foreign exposure while I get paid to do it.

Here are 3 things that changed my life:
1. I met people through events on Luma and built my network in US
2. Started building in public and sharing my story which slowly created my brand and got me leads
3. Offered services to businesses I met in US to help them grow on social

Converted them into a monthly retainer client and hired people in India to automate the work.

I spend in India, get paid from US companies, leading to an insane 60% profit margin.

I didn’t spend years getting a degree.

I didn’t take crores of loan.

I didn’t fight to get a corporate job.

I simply used to internet, built my brand, and reached out to the people who can afford what I sell.

I made a video explaining this in much more depth. Comment “dollar” to get the link
